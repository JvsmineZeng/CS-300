# CS-300 - Project 1 + 2 - CS Course Advising Software

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
> I was responsible for designing and developing an academic course planner for the computer science department at ABCU. The application needed the following features:
> 1. Ability to properly read a file containing course information. Each course had a course ID, course name, and course prerequisites (if applicable).
> 2. Display a menu with the options to load the file, print a list of all courses, print information for a specific course, or exit.
> 3. Ability to load the file into a data structure.
> 4. Ability to alphanumerically sort and print a list of courses from the file.
> 5. Ability to print information for a specific course.
> This application would continue running until the user enters the exit command.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
> In the early stages of development, I decided to use the binary tree structure. Choosing a particular data structure was the first and most important step because it affects my design and code. The alternative data structures were vectors and hashtables. The binary tree structure required me to initialize and write pointers and pre, post, and regular order functions for sorting and reading. Moreover, the binary tree structure helped me consider the end-user experience and requirements of the application; although it produces the longest potential runtime of the three data structures, it possesses strong searching and sorting functions which an academic planner application needs.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
> I felt overwhelmed with the design of the binary tree structure. However, I referred to my notes and assignments in Module 5 to figure out how to construct and initialize variables and functions for binary tree sorting. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
> This project taught me three common data structures used in the industry, and the pros and cons of each. I also learned how to select one of them for a software based on the client and end-user's requirements. Moreover, I learned how to program a software based on the data structure and its method of reading, searching, and sorting. Overall, I gained a wider scope on the design and development of programs by considering the needs of all parties and phases of the project.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> This project helped me refer to industry standards and best practices. From a nontechnical perspective, data management softwares may seem extremely abstract and complex. This was my perspective before going into computer science, and before taking this course. However, the presence of common data structures show that the industry has already formulated certain ways for designing and developing these softwares. Additionally, each data structure requires certain functions for reading, searching and sorting (i.e., pointers and pre, post, and regular order functions for sorting and reading).
